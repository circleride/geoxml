#How to avoid conflicts between JQuery and geoxml.js

= Introduction =

jQuery has a function that is defined as "$" *so does GeoXML*.

jQuery has a nifty little thing that allows you to change the name of its $method to something else.

= Details =

[http://docs.jquery.com/Using_jQuery_with_Other_Libraries This page]
gives you all possible solutions, here is the simplest.

In a configuration where your jQuery `$(function(){...}` is above all the geoxml call and where jquery.js has been loaded before geoxml.js, here is a method that will make everything work :

Change your global jQuery `$(function(){...}` to :
{{{
var $j = jQuery;
$j(function(){
    $j("#div").hide();
    //other jquery code ....
});
}}}
Then change every jquery snippet beginning with `$(...)` call to `$j(...)`.
