#How to avoid conflicts between JQuery and geoxml.js

= Introduction =

GeoXml has a function that is defined as $ so does jquery.
jquery has a nifty little thing that allows you to change the
name of its $method to something else

= Details =

This page
[http://docs.jquery.com/Using_jQuery_with_Other_Libraries]
gives you a few solutions

In a configuration where your jQuery `$(function(){...}` is above all the geoxml call and where jquery.js has been loaded before geoxml.js, here is a method that will make everything work :

Change your global jQuery `$(function(){...}` to :
{{{
var $j = jQuery;
$j(function(){
    $j("#div").hide();
    //other jquery code ....
});
}}}
Then change every jquery snippet beginning with `$(...)` call to `$j(...)`.
